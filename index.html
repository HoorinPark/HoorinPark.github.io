<br />
I am an Assistant Professor in Department of Information Security at Seoul Women's University (SWU). I am interested in computer network systems, especially their security and privacy. I believe that effective prototyping can help us identify and address security threats more effectively. I am particularly interested in the implementation of proposed wireless network systems using software-defined hardware. Before joining SWU, I was a research professor in Future Network Center at Korea University.
